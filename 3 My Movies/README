*Assignment #3 – OOP: My Favourite Movies*
Due Date: __________________________

For this assignment, you will be writing a Java program that reads in a file that contains a list of movies, and
then allow the user to find movie information based on the search criteria.

In the input file, each line contains 3 pieces of information:
 Rating of the movie – an integer or real number followed by % sign (ie. 43.8%)
 Movie title – any number of words
 Genre –always one word

Your program should allow the user to perform two actions:

1. It should repeatedly ask the user for a movie title and display the stats, until the user types in the
word “exit”.

Sample output:
Movie title: Captain Marvel
Genre: Action
Rating: 78.0%
Ranking: 2 out of 15 ( notice the output includes the total # of entries)

2. It should also allow the user to enter in a genre, and the program will list all the movies and
their information of that genre, IN ALPHABETICAL order of the title.
The output would be similar to above, except there may be more than one movie listed.

Extra Hints and Comments:

1. The file will be given in the following format:
Rating Title Genre
e.g. 97.1% The Social Network Drama

2. You should create a new class to keep track of the movie information (rating, title genre.)
 To make this simpler, we will assume that the rating and the genre fields can be
duplicated, but the title field is always unique. In other words, each movie occurs only
ONCE in the movie file.
 The genre field is always one word.

3. Use ArrayLists to implement your list of objects. DO NOT use Arrays.

4. You must use Binary Search to search for movie titles and genres -- – not allowed to use loops to
search through the list of names and powers.

5. Make this efficient – minimize the amount of sorting that needs to be done!

6. Remember to do all the proper error checks. For example, if the title entered in does not exist,
capital genre should be same as lower case, etc.

7. There WILL be improper inputs in the input file. The ONLY time the line should be skipped, is if
at least one piece of information is missing.

ICS4U1 Date: ______________________
BONUS:
(+1 mark) - Allow for duplicate movie titles

- When title/genre is searched for, you will ask the user how they want the result to be
sorted. It can be sorted alphabetically by genre (if title is searched) or title (if genre is
searched), or by ranking from highest to lowest.
